# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Classifier

This project demonstrates the process of building a **machine learning classifier** to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on weather data.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply **data science and machine learning techniques** to real-world weather data.  
The steps include:
- Importing and exploring the dataset  
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Building and evaluating a classification model  
- Making predictions on unseen data

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is **Australian weather data**.  

- 📍 Available on Kaggle: [Weather Dataset (Rattle Package)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package?resource=download&select=weatherAUS.csv)  

It contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas` → data manipulation  
  - `numpy` → numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` → machine learning models and evaluation

## 📊 Model & Results
- Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.  
- Several classifiers were tested (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
- The final model was evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
