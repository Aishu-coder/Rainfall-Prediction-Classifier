## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to apply **data science and machine learning techniques** to real-world weather data.  
The steps include:
- Importing and exploring the dataset  
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Building and evaluating a classification model  
- Making predictions on unseen data

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is **Australian weather data**.  

- 📍 Available on Kaggle: [Weather Dataset (Rattle Package)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package?resource=download&select=weatherAUS.csv)  

It contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall.
